    Want to upload a sound for your Discord server? Make sure you have fed Jacques! Click the <span><md-icon
        id="sound-upload-birdfeed-icon" md-svg-icon="birdfeed"></md-icon></span> birdfeed icon on the toolbar. Once
    you've given him birdfeed, you're good to go.

    Your file's name will become its sound name. For example, if you upload "mySound.mp3", it can then be played with
    <i>!mySound</i>. For additional help, visit the <a ui-sref="help">help page</a>.
