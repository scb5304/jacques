    Want to upload a sound for your Discord server? Make sure you have fed Jacques! Click the <span><md-icon id="sound-upload-birdfeed-icon" md-svg-icon="birdfeed"></md-icon></span> birdfeed icon on the toolbar. Once you've given him birdfeed, you're good to go.

    Each of your files' names will become their sound names. For example, if you upload "mySound.mp3", it can then be played with <i>mySound</i>. For additional help, visit the <a ui-sref="help">help page</a>.
