    <p>
        Jacques is a soundboard bot engineered to play audio in Discord voice channels. He supports user-uploaded
        sounds
        as well as YouTube videos. This website serves as a portal to view usage data about the Discord servers Jacques
        runs on,
        the sounds that are uploaded, as well as the entry point for user-submitted sounds.
    </p>

    <p>
        You don't need to run anything yourself. Jacques runs on his own server and maintains sounds for each of the
        discord servers he's on. Visit the <a ui-sref="help">help</a> page if you need assistance getting started.
