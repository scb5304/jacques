        <p>
            Jacques is a soundboard bot engineered to play audio in <a href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord</a> voice
            channels. He supports user-uploaded sounds as well as YouTube videos. This website serves as a portal to
            view usage data about the Discord servers
            Jacques runs on, the sounds that are uploaded, as well as the entry point for user-submitted sounds.
            Currently, he hosts <b>{{$ctrl.statisticsObject.soundsCount}}</b> sounds across <b>{{$ctrl.statisticsObject.guildsCount}}</b>
            guilds. Sounds have been played a total of <b>{{$ctrl.statisticsObject.soundEventsCount}}</b> times.
        </p>

        <p>
            You don't need to run anything yourself. Jacques runs on his own server and maintains sounds for each of the
            discord servers he's on. Visit the <a ui-sref="help">help</a> page if you need assistance getting started.

            Jacques is used as an experiment in <a href="http://mean.io/">MEAN</a> stack development. The discord bot
            provides the data set and structure for this website. Features, functionality, and availability are subject
            to drastic, sudden changes. Also, the logos below are pretty. Look at Jacques' package.json on
